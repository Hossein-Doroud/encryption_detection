#This file contains the features extracted from the Randomness tests and the corresponding label
#The features are basically a statistaical representation (mean and standard deviation) of the p-values
#Each RT on each input(payload) generates one p-vlaue, for mulitple p-values the mean(M) and standard(S) deviation are calculated as featuers
#label = 0 for non-encrypted data
#label = 1 for encrypted data
#Labels are extracted from GTfile specified in Configuration.ini file and translated based on translator.cpp file
#NOTE: If there is no output, check the GTfile parameter in Configuration.ini file
#Randmoness Tests should be in this order if used (uncommented in Configuration file):
#FrequencyTest, BlockFreqTest, SerialTest, CumulativeSumTest, ApproximateEntropyTest, DescreteFourierTransformTest, LongestRunsOfOnesTest, RunsTest, TopologicalBinaryTest, GreatesCommonDivisorTest
#Example: FreqM and FreqS represent the mean and standard deviation values of FrequencyTest
