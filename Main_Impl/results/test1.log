#RESULTS , Flows in pcap file
#/mnt/c/Users/ahmad/Desktop/Thesis/pcap_files/test_pcap_output/t1.pcap
#This file contains the flow five tuple, label and prediction result
#five tuple are the biflow info which is examined for training OR classification
#label : can have values according to translator function see translator.cpp
#label = -1 this is undefined label(unknown)
#label = 254 this means the flow is not found in GTfile 
#prediction : can have values according to the classificaton classes defined 
#in ANN classification with its trained model
#prediction = -1 this means the value is not defined - should be only in training phase
